Introduction
---------

The pipeline project is a collection of shell scripts designed to simplify project development and deployment. It includes all the project tools, which can be downloaded separately from the release sectionâ€”already signed and ready to use on any Mac without requiring a build process. Aimed at developers, it provides access to project source code, scripts, and utilities to streamline the development workflow.

Additionally, the project serves as an experimental test bed for signing and deploying Mac applications.

The 3rdparty project must be built for the pipeline project.

* https://github.com/mikaelsundell/3rdparty

This ensures that the pipeline project efficiently compiles and installs various code projects along with their respective dependencies.

To initialize the pipeline, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
source ./pipeline.sh
```

Furthermore, to incorporate Pipeline into your .zshrc for automatic setup, append the following script:

```shell
export PIPELINE_DIR="<pipeline>"
if [[ -f "$PIPELINE_DIR/pipeline.sh" ]]; then
    source "$PIPELINE_DIR/pipeline.sh"
else
    echo "pipeline.sh not found in $PIPELINE_DIR, skipping..."
fi
```

To configure your environment for development with debug versions of libraries, use the following command:

```shell
setdebug
```

This sets your environment to use libraries compiled with debugging symbols, facilitating debugging and development.

For configuring your environment to use release versions of libraries, optimized for performance and without debugging symbols, execute:

```shell
setrelease
```

Code projects
-------------

#### Building projects

To build the projects within the pipeline, navigate to the projects directory inside your pipeline folder and execute the build script:

```shell
cdprojects
./build.sh
```
#### Building for Xcode (Optional)

If you are developing with Xcode and would like to configure the build for Xcode, you can add the --xcode option to the build command. This will enable specific configurations suitable for Xcode development:

```shell
cdprojects
./build.sh --xcode
```

This option ensures that the projects are built using the Xcode generator with directory prefix -xcode, making them compatible with Xcode development environments. Projects built with Xcode will not install due to signing issues, Xcode is only intended for development only.

#### brawtool
